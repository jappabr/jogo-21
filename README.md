## game-21
Academic project for the development of the <strong>simplified</strong> version "Black Jack".<br><br>
## The system works like this:
<br> 
Every time you start a game, you start with two cards and have up to a limit of 5 to reach 21, if you get a smaller number, it is compared with the cards in the system to see who comes closest to define the winner.
<br>
Enjoy!
